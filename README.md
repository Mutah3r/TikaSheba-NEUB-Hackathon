## 💉 Project - TikaSheba

> **TikaSheba** is an integrated, secure, and data-driven platform designed to **digitally transform and streamline the end-to-end national vaccination workflow**. It resolves critical issues like fragmented workflows, manual logging, and poor forecasting by offering role-based access to citizens, vaccination centers, staff, and health authorities. By leveraging a modern MERN stack architecture and integrating **advanced AI/ML automation** (including Meta Prophet and Gemini API), TikaSheba ensures real-time visibility, optimized stock management, and proactive demand forecasting to achieve maximum vaccination coverage and operational efficiency.

-----

## Problem Addressed 🛑

TikaSheba targets the following critical inefficiencies in traditional vaccination management:

  * **Fragmented Workflows:** Disjointed processes across citizens, centers, and authorities leading to missed appointments, poor coordination, and user frustration.
  * **Operational Inefficiencies:** Reliance on manual coordination and paper-based logs hindering real-time tracking of vaccine usage, staff activity, and stock levels.
  * **Mismatched Capacity and Demand:** Limited or non-existent forecasting capability causing critical mismatches between center capacity, available stock, and citizen appointment demand.
